This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Kotlin related to the unexpected behavior of the `removeIf` function when used on mutable collections. The `removeIf` function iterates through the collection and removes elements based on a given predicate. However, when the predicate modifies the collection's structure during iteration, the behavior can be inconsistent between different collection types like Lists and Maps.  The example code shows how a seemingly simple use of `removeIf` can lead to unexpected results. The solution file provides alternative strategies to avoid these issues.
